🃏 Flashcard — LeetCode 452: Min Arrows to Burst Balloons

Problem (plain words):
You’re given balloons represented by intervals [start, end] on a number line. An arrow shot at x bursts every balloon covering x. Find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons.

Analogy / Story:
🎯 Imagine balloons floating at different ranges along a wall. You shoot an arrow straight up at some x coordinate. That arrow pops all balloons covering x. Goal: use as few arrows as possible.

Core Idea (Pattern):
👉 Greedy Interval Merging

Sort balloons by starting position.

If current balloon overlaps with the previous one → merge (keep the tightest overlapping interval).

If not overlapping → need a new arrow.

Key Code Snippet (minimal):

points.sort()
count = len(points)
prev = points[0]

for curr in points[1:]:
    if curr[0] <= prev[1]:             # overlap
        count -= 1                     # one arrow pops both
        prev = [curr[0], min(prev[1], curr[1])]
    else:                              # no overlap → new arrow
        prev = curr

return count


Patterns / Buckets:

Greedy

Interval problems (merge intervals, meeting rooms).

Sorting-based sweep.

Complexity:

Time: O(n log n) (sorting dominates).

Space: O(1) (if sorting is in place).

✅ Quick Recall Tip:
“Sort balloons → if overlap, merge with tighter range; else new arrow.”
